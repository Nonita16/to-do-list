# To-Do List app ðŸ“‹

A simple To-Do List app built with React, utilizing localStorage for persistent tasks, custom hooks for reusable logic, and reducers with action creators to manage state efficiently. The UI is styled with CSS and structured with HTML for a clean and intuitive experience. 

Users can add, delete, search and mark tasks as completed, with all changes saved automatically in localStorage for a seamless experience.
